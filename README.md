## Project 1 Automation of Systems and Processes with Python

### Challenge:

Every day, our system updates sales from the previous day.
Your daily job, as an analyst, is to send an email to the board, as soon as you start work, with the billing and quantity of products sold the day before

Board e-mail: seugmail+diretoria@gmail.com <br>
Location where the system provides the sales of the previous day: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149xknr9JvrlEnhNWO49zPcw0PW5icxga?usp=sharing

To solve this, let's use pyautogui, a keyboard and mouse command automation library

## Project 2 Data Analysis with Python

### Challenge:

You work for a telecom company and have clients for several different services, including the main ones: internet and telephone.

The problem is that, looking at the customer history of the last few years, you noticed that the company has Churn of more than 26% of the customers.

This represents a loss of millions for the company.

What does the company need to do to resolve this?

## Project 4 Web Automation and Information Search with Python

#### Challenge:

We work at an importer and the price of our products is linked to the quotation of:
- Dollar
- Euro
- Gold

We need to automatically get the quotation for these 3 items on the internet and find out how much we should charge for our products, considering a contribution margin that we have in our database.

Database: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2lpxoi9heyQV1hIlsHXWSfDkBPtze-V?usp=sharing

For this, let's create a web automation:

- We will use selenium (automation and browser control)
- Important: download the webdriver
    - Google chrome -> chormedriver
    - firefox -> geckodriver
